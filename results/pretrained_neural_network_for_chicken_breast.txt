We address the problem of automating classification of chicken breast images. A pretrained convolutional neural network was fine-tuned and evaluated on an 80/20 train/validation split. Training and validation loss curves demonstrate [trend]. The model achieved [X%] sensitivity and [Y%] specificity across categories, with a confusion matrix highlighting [strengths/weaknesses]. These results show feasibility of transfer learning in food-quality applications and lay the groundwork for interpretable models using extracted embeddings.

1. Introduction
---------------
Automation in food safety and bioprocessing requires robust classification methods.
Prior approaches [cite any papers] rely on manual inspection or classical machine vision.
Deep learning offers high accuracy but limited interpretability.  
**Objective**: to train and evaluate a pretrained CNN on chicken breast images and prepare features for simpler classifiers.

2. Methods
----------
- Dataset: [# samples, categories, split 80/20]  
- Preprocessing: resize to 224Ã—224, normalize to ImageNet stats, augmentations (flip, rotation).  
- Model: ResNet18 pretrained on ImageNet, final FC replaced.  
- Training: optimizer=Adam, lr=1e-3, batch=32, epochs=3.  
- Metrics: loss, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix.  
- Environment: PyTorch, TensorBoard, Colab GPU.

3. Results
----------
- Fig. 1: Training vs Validation Loss (insert plot).
- Fig. 2: Confusion Matrix (insert plot).
- Table 1: Sensitivity & Specificity by class.  
Performance summary: Validation loss plateaued at [value]; training loss [describe].  

4. Discussion
-------------
Results indicate that the network learned meaningful features, with sensitivity [high/low] and specificity [trend].  
Main challenges: small dataset, misclassification between [classes].  
Future work: use embeddings for decision trees/forests, expand dataset, explore augmentations.

5. Conclusion
-------------
This pilot demonstrates that pretrained CNNs can classify chicken breast images with reasonable accuracy, setting the stage for interpretable downstream classifiers.
